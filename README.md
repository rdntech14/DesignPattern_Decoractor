Decorator Design Pattern in Java
=====

# What is Decorator Design Pattern

It is a structural pattern.

Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.

In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.
